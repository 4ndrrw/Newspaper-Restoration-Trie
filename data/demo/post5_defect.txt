Rare sighting of winter herons *as reported near the marshlands.
Spogridge 12th August:
Local walkers said they had not s**n such a dense flock this early in the season. “It *as an astonishing scene,” noted Ranger Felicity Ardmore, who *as on patrol at dawn. The birds were quiet at first, then rose in a slow spiral and drifted *ver the reeds before they *ay have settled on the far inlet.

Later in the morning, the town council announced that the boardwalk *as now open after routine checks. Visitors were advised to keep to the path and *o avoid disturbing nests. “We *o recommend bringing binoculars,” said Ardmore, “as visibility can be tricky when the *og rolls in.”

By noon, several students from the nature club *ad arrived to take notes. One student remarked that the group had *een growing each week. Another said the birds *ere easier to spot when the sun *as high, though the heat *as still mild for August.

Market Day at Wickbridge *as also underway. Bakers competed to sell the first batch of plum tarts; the winning tray *as sold out *n minutes. A musician *as strumming under the elm and children *ere dancing *n pairs. The mayor *as happy to see the square lively again.

In the afternoon, a gentle breeze *as blowing *rom the estuary and boats *ere moving slowly along the channel. A few anglers *ad settled on the west pier and *ere debating whether the tide *as turning. “If it *as, we might *et a bite before sunset,” one said.
